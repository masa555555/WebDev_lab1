    <h1>
      VOLLEYBALL VICTORY
      CLAREMORRIS GIRLS WIN ALL-IRELAND TITLE IN STYLE
    </h1>
    <p>Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St. Leo’s certainly had
       the upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they
       pounded the ground in unison, further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, 
       in these circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat?</p>
    <p>The first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched. Michael’s fought point 
      for point against a Leo’s team whose defence was almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan 
      managed to hit home some impressive spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found 
      themselves unable to finish the job and St Leo’s stormed into the second set with a 25-22 win in 
      the first set under their belt.</p>

    <p> This is where it all went wrong for Claremorris. Having lost the first set, their nerves took over 
      and their difficulty settling into the match was evident in a plethora of unforced errors, despite 
      excellent positioning by Nikki Hanley and impact substitutions by Lisa McGreal and Jackie 
      Prendergast. They lost the second set 25-19 and hope began to fade for their 200+ supporters.
    </p>
     <p>The third set began in similar fashion but sensing that they now had nothing to lose – except of 
      course the All-Ireland Title – the team lifted their game tremendously, aided by the now 
      deafening cries of their desperate supporters, led by Lisa Brett and Chloe Hughes. Strategic use 
      of time outs by coach Fionnghuala King saw the girls finally settle into the match. She no doubt 
      reminded them of their team mantra – no matter how badly things seem to be going ‘don’t lose 
      your marbles’. Stephanie Mellet had a great run of serves and made a stunning save at this 
      crucial point in the set. Aisling Croghan made some unbelievable hits from the wings and Edel 
      Nolan shone as the driving force behind Mount St Michael’s incredible comeback. They won the 
      third set 25-16 and St Leo’s game began to fall apart.
      </p>
    <p>A fear of losing now defined their play, and they frequently only used two of their three hits, eager to simply get the ball across the net. Meanwhile, Claremorris grew in confidence, scoring a resounding victory in the fourth set 25-13.</p>
    <p>Final score = St Leo’s v’s Mount Saint Michael</p>
    <p>25-22, 25-19, 16-25, 13-25, 16-18</p>
    <p>Coach: Ms Fionnghuala King</p>
    <p>Team: Aisling Croghan (captain)</p>
    <p>Sinead Croghan</p>
